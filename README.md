## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

To use this application, your system must meet the following requirements:

- **GPU:** NVIDIA graphics card with at least **6 GB of VRAM**.
- **RAM:** **16 GB** of system memory.
- **OS:** Windows 10 or 11.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation (First time only)

1.  Double-click on the `setup.bat` file.

    -   üì• Download and install a portable version of Miniconda.
    -   üì¶ Create an isolated Python environment to keep your system clean.
    -   ‚öôÔ∏è Install all necessary libraries (PyTorch, etc.).
    -   üß† Download the 3 required GGUF models directly into the `models/` folder.
3.  Once the installation is complete, the window will prompt you to press any key to close it.
